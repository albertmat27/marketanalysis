#Bitcoin News Market Insights

**Created 11:16 am November 12, 2014**

We can estimate the relative market share of news companies by comparing social
media reach because social media is a key news distribution channel. For example,
CoinDesk has 52.8k twitter followers, Bitcoin Magazine has 30.3k, CryptoCoinsNews
has 25.4k, and Bitcoinist has 2.1k. Following this back of the envelope estimate
tells us that CoinDesk is currently leading as the bitcoin news site with the
widest reach.

At least 44% of the CoinDesk team is editing. Founded May 1, 2013, the team has a
total of 18 members — 6 journalists, 8 total editors (2 contributing editors, 2 sub-
editors, 1 Asia editor, 1 US editor, 1 assistant editor, 1 managing editor), 1 back-
end developer, 1 front-end developer, 1 head of performance marketing, and 1
product manager. 2 editors have a journalism bachelor’s degree.

Surely CoinDesk’s focus on editing helps produce polished pieces, but CoinDesk’s 
unfair advantage is it’s set of financial analysis tools like the CoinDesk Bitcoin 
Price index, price calculators, and charts. The CoinDesk price index is unique, 
accessible via a simple API, and created by CoinDesk.

Bitcoinist is uniquely the only company that delivers weekly news videos. However,
other companies can deliver similar short weekly news bits, and they have. CoinDesk
started publishing weekly news videos on their YouTube channel in early March, but
stopped producing them in mid June. If we assume that most people will not watch
old news, CoinDesk weekly roundups got 3.9k views on average. By comparison, 
Bitcoinist weekly videos get an order of magnitude less views now, but should 
increase because there is at least a group of 4k people that if reached, would 
consume bitcoin news in video form via YouTube.

CryptoCoinsNews’s may have live trader chat, CoinTelegraph talented animators, and
Bitcoin Magazine print content, but it is Let’s Talk Bitcoin that has a unique and
difficult to replicate advantage.

Let’s Talk Bitcoin, or LTB is an ecosystem launched on June 27. It contains several
podcasts, a forum, and blogs created by independent content creators who are 
rewarded by the Let’s Talk Bitcoin platform. The ecosystem’s incentive mechanisms 
like proof-of-participation and proof-of-publishing have attracted at least 5 
sister podcast shows to the platform: Bitcoins and Gravy, Beyond Bitcoin, Bitcoin 
Game, P2P Connect Us, and Permacredits. These sister shows now account for about 
30% of the audio content on the ecosystem. LTB has 15.1k twitter followers and 4.9k 
subscribers on their YouTube channel.

There is an opportunity to use proof-of-publishing and a review or editing process 
to incentivize news content creation.

**Example:**

**Simple Proof-of-Publishing**

1) There is 1.5 bitcoins that are available for weekly distribution to writers 
based on daily contributions.

2) 250 millibits are up for grabs daily and we want to incentivize the writing of 4 
articles.

3) First four articles written and revised after peer review receive 62.6 millibits 
each for a total of 250 millibits.

**Simple Proof-of-Review**

1) Create a rubric that accentuates desired qualities of a written piece.
Example qualities covered in a rubric: - Captivating Headline
- Attention grabbing Lede
- Body answers who, what, when, where, why and how.
- Spelling and Grammar
- Article Length is at least 300 words, but is not more than 1000.

2) Articles in need of review are posted

3) First article review is rewarded 15.65 millibits

4) Cycle can be repeated manifold.

Of course it is important to keep these processes simple because running these 
incentive mechanisms without a coded protocol requires management overhead, and the
more complicated the mechanism the greater the overhead. However, the value of 
experimenting with these mechanisms is that they are working right now for the 
Let’s Talk Bitcoin ecosystem, and could work for other organizations like news 
agencies because both depend on content creation.

Thoughts and conversation are welcome.
